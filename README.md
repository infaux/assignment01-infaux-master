In this assignment you will start with the github classroom link, create your own assignment repository, clone it to your computer, make modifications to the unity project, commit the changes, and push back the updated repository to github.

## Potential Resources:

- YouTube Videos on Unity and GitHub
	- [How to use GitHub with Unity](https://youtu.be/qpXxcvS-g3g)

- Modification of Unity project.
	- Addition of 3D shapes.
	- Creation of materials.
	- Addition of assets (texturemap).
- Committing changes to Unity project and pushing to remote github repository.

## Directions
1. Accept github classroom assignment via link provided in slack.

2. On a local resource clone the newly created repository.

3. Modify Unity project.
Add shapes to the scene, to fill the matching shape and orientations.
	- Add a cube to the scene (e.g 4.5 units scale), a rotation of 45 on Y axis
	- Add a sphere (radius 10) to the scene, and place it in the sphere shape area
	- Add a cylinder to the scene, and find out the right dimensions and orientation to match the cylinder area in Unity
4. Commit changes to repository, remember to add a useful commit message.
5. Push committed changes to github, I will look for commit messages in the repository.
6. Change the color of the sphere to red.
7. Add a texturemap of your choice to the cube.
8. Make the cylinder a green semitransparent color.
